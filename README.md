# Event Connect: Bringing communities together.

# Project Description

This purpose of this project was to collaborate with a group of developers to create a full stack interactive application with the following criterias:

```
1. Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
2. Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.
3. Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
4. Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
5. Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.
6. Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
7. Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
8. Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
9. Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
10. Have a polished UI.
11. Be responsive.
12. Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
13. Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
14. Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```

Our application utilizes Ticketmaster's Events API. Our team committed to utilizing this API due to the variety of different functionalities, as well as the versitile content that it offers. Our main objective was to have the ability for the user to access Ticketmaster's API which has a constantly evolving database of musical artists and link that together with the ability to search local cities. We also connected a message board for those attending each show which users can log into and post about in order to hopefully build community and bring people together with music.

Event Connect's current components: 

```
• Home Page
• Login and Registration for new and existing users
• Date and city picker to reveal upcoming shows at venues
• Message board for users to communicate and share experiences
•  
```

We initially built the database and then setup the routes and user pages as a template. The Api was then chosen to be integrated afterwards to have a more freefrom design. We utilized many handlebars to form the basis for the website and handle the different pages that would be created as well as the client side input. Along the way we encountered multiple issues regarding MVC and had to work together and reformat the code to reflect a cleaner and more streamlined application.
