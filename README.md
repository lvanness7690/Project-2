# Event Connect: Bringing communities together.

# Project Description

This purpose of this project was to collaborate with a group of developers to create an application with the following criterias:

```
1. Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
2. Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.
3. Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
4. Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
5. Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.
6. Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
7. Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
8. Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
9. Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
10. Have a polished UI.
11. Be responsive.
12. Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
13. Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
14. Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```

Our application utilizes Ticketmaster's Events API. Our team committed to utilizing this API due to the variety of different functionalities, as well as the compelling content that it offers. Our main objective was to have the ability for the user to access NASA's APOD API which has a giant database of pictures related to astronomy; complete with an identifying title and brief summary of the photograph taken.

Event Connect's current components: 

```
• Home Page
• Login and Registration for new and existing users
• Date picker to traverse through NASA's APOD  
```

We initially built the HTML and then slightly formatted the CSS to have a basic interface and in conjunction with Javascript, created the functionality that allows the user to fetch, retrieve, and display the data inside NASA's APOD API. From there, our team established a date picker in order to grant the user the capability to display the picture of the day from the date of their choosing.
